        <h1>Rip Currents</h1>
		<h2>What are rip currents?</h2>

        <p>
			Rip currents are fast flowing currents of water returning back to deeper water.
			Water brought to the shore by waves has to go back. In some places, these
			channels (sort of rivers) of water flow faster then Olympic swimmers.
		</p>
		
		<h2>What to do if you get caught in one.</h2>

		<p>
			Best is not to get caught in a rip. If you are caught in one, don't try to swim against
			the rip. Stay calm and swim parallel to the beach and once you get out of the channel,
			catch a wave and try to get back to the shore with the wave.

			Do not get into open water if you don't know how to swim or know anything about 
			rip currents.
