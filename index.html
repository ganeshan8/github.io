        <p>
			Muriwai Beach is a good beach for surfing and bodyboarding.
			However, there are very strong 
			<a href="pages\ripcurrents.html">rip currents</a> and it is best to
			find out about the dangers of rip currents before you visit
			Muriwai Beach. Muriwai is on the west coast of Auckland
			above the Waitakere Ranges and is home to a large colony
			of gannets.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over a thousand gannets return from Australia every year
			between August and March.
		</p>


		<p>
			There is a car park near the beach, which leads
			to a range of viewing platforms that allow visitors
			to close up views of the colony and the rough coastline.
